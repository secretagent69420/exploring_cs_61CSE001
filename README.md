> ### There was a dream that was Rome. You could only whisper it. Anything more than a whisper and it would vanish, it was so fragile.
> ### - Marcus Aurelius

> ### Too many men have died at its edge. It may look pure... , but only because blood washes so easily from its blade.
> ### - Li Mu Bai

> ### Is Rome worth one good man's life? We believed it once. Make us believe it again. He was a soldier of Rome. Honor him.
> ### - Lucilla

> ### I made a lot of sacrifices, a lot of hard choices, for honor, for king, for country. You wanna know what I have learned boy? Hard choices and sacrifices do not keep you warm at night. Life's too damn short too damn long to go through without someone at your side. Don't end up like me, choose the woman. Fight for love, D'Artagnan. France will take care of itself.
> ### - Athos de la FÃ¨re
